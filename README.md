1️⃣ What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

Answer:
These methods are used to select HTML elements in JavaScript, but they work differently.

getElementById:
It selects one element by id.
Id is unique, so it returns only one element.

getElementsByClassName:
It selects elements by class name.
It returns multiple elements by HTMLCollection.

querySelector:
It selects the first matching element like tagname, id, class.

querySelectorAll:
It selects all matching elements.
It returns a NodeList.

2️⃣ How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?

Answer:
We can create a new HTML element using createElement() method and add it to the page using appendChild() method.
